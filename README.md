# wierd_lang
A dumb languge Im making for fun that allows variable variable names and function definition in loops
how variables work
*sdjfsfgsagfhsa
  * makes any thing after it a literal so put whatever u want there even if its another idenfiter
$variable 
  replaces that with the value of variable variable
%variable
  replaces that with the variable whos name is the given variable
print ahhhhh
  prints stuff
getv variable
  I forget how this works
while (check to make l = less than g = greaten than, = = equal to, l= less than or equalt to, g= greater than or equal to.) variable1 variable2 recur_statement_to_run time
  so while l $var1 $var2 dostuff would be while $var1 < $var2 dostuff also any of those args can be variables if u want, time is the delay between runs and is required
recur recur_name: print this is the first command & print this is the second command
  anything can be put inside a recur ANYTHING, the & divides the two commands you can chain them by putting recur_r other_recur_name in the second 
  name to run a second one from the first one
recur_r name
  runs the recur the name can also be a variable
if = $var $var2 dostuff
  read while but its single not repeating
mani type(+,-,/,*) arg1 arg2 result_store_variable
  manipulates two data things ofc anything can be a variable and the last arg is where the result is stored
conc var1 $var2 store_loc
  anything can be var concats two strings and puts them in the variable that is the  last arg
THIS LANGUGE IS VERY BROKEN AND IM A LOSER SO IF UR READING THIS DONT ACTUALLY RUN THIS REPO
